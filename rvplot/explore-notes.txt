This first analysis considers just (HSW, SV, Branchy), and focuses on
*total* operations, i.e., summed over all iterations for each problem.

Some observations:

- Loads and branches are highly correlated, which makes sense since
  every branch is preceded by a load. As such, a fit should eliminate
  one of these (e.g., branches).

- Loads and stores are anti-correlated. (Why?)

- Cycles and mispredictions are most strongly correlated. (Why?)

- Cycles and RS stalls are not correlated. (Why not?)

- Linear regression with an intercept produces a large, negative
  intercept -- so not useful / hard to interpret. Should probably
  stick with nnls-derived models.

- Linear regression without an intercept produces a better fit than
  above, but with a small negative "stores" coefficient -- so also -
  hard to interpret. Nevertheless, it gives a nice result that
  attributes most of the execution time variability to branch
  mispredictions, as we'd hope.


Questions / issues:

- If cycles and mispredictions are strongly correlated, but RS
  stalls are not, what may we conclude?

- We are not including cache misses in our counters. We may need to
  include them, so that we can justify excluding them. :)
